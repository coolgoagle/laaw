                    <p>Have you ever put into question that maybe the ability to carry firearms is a hazard rather than
                        a defense? Just between 1999 and 2016, 572,537 total gun deaths have occurred including 336,579
                        suicides, 213,175 homicides, and 11,428 unintentional deaths. Gun laws should become more strict
                        to prevent death and save lives.</p>

                    <p>Gun laws are not strict enough, resulting in the deaths of others (homicides) which could be
                        easily prevented. Countries that preserve restrictive gun laws have been reported to have lower
                        homicide and suicide rates than countries in which they are tolerant. Researchers have found
                        that the “general barrier to firearm access created through state regulation can have a
                        significant deterrent effect on male suicide rates in the United States” (P. Cummings, et al.,
                        "The Association between the Purchase of a Handgun and Homicide or Suicide," American Journal of
                        Public Health, June 1997). Some may argue that guns can be used for self-defense, but this
                        simply is not the world we live in. When there is a privilege, there is always someone to misuse
                        it.</p>

                    <p>Guns are rarely used in self-defense. Of the 29 million violent crimes, only 0.79% of victims
                        between 2007 and 2011 actually protected themselves using a firearm (Michael Planty and Jennifer
                        L. Truman, "Firearm Violence, 1993-2011," bjs.gov, May 2013). While 62 mass shootings occurred
                        between 1982 and 2012, none of them were stopped by armed civilians. Some may argue that guns
                        are used in self-defense when it comes to property crimes, but between 2007 and 2011, only 0.12%
                        of victims used or threatened to use a gun to defend themselves in regard to property crime.</p>

                    <p>The Second Amendment wasn’t even meant to support individuals owning/possessing guns, it was to
                        protect the right of MILITIAS owning guns (US Supreme Court, District of Columbia, et al. v.
                        Heller, supremecourt.gov, October 2007). Skeptics may insist that it is equally as important for
                        an individual to have a gun as it is a militia since one must defend themself in case of an
                        intruder. Although, one can’t justify that. As said previously, most deaths in relation to
                        violence have not been stopped through the right to bear arms, rather it has contributed to the
                        darker side of it all.</p>

                    <p>Overall, the laxness of gun laws must be stopped for the safety of individuals. Making gun laws
                        more strict would reduce the death and crime rates drastically. Despite the argument of
                        self-defense, the statistics show that they are very rarely utilized in these circumstances and
                        do not make a major impact. The right that we have mistaken to shield the validity to own guns
                        was not directed towards individuals such as ourselves. We must support stricter gun laws for
                        the betterment and safety of our civilization.</p>
